# REON DNS Server

This server code is **not ours**. It is Sylverant's PSO DNS, with two modifications:

- Removed the Dreamcast check so any DNS client can request.

- Change the path to `/etc/reon/conf/dns.conf` for Linux.

The sample config in the repository will need modifying for your server name (change `XXXX` to your 4 char subdomain).
